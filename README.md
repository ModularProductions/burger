# burger
## Purpose
This application demonstrates MySQL database manipulation via an ORM, in a Model-Controller-View environment presented with Handlebars templating. The user is allowed to create a hamburger, then eat the virtually delicious figment of data. The freshly om'ed nom is moved to another area, where the user is provided the option to delete it. Cleaning the plate, as it were.

## Usage
Not much to it, really. Enter a name, then use the buttons as labeled.

## Validation
Strictly speaking, you don't HAVE to enter a hamburger name, although vegetarian meals will be refused. (Just kidding.)
